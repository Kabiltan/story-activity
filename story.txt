A duck walks up to a lemonade stand and asks the man there if they sell any grapes. The man tells the duck that he doesn't, as the only thing he sells is lemonade. He offered a glass of lemonade to the duck, but the duck replied, "I'll pass." And then the duck waddled away.

Nate's Paragraph
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man running the stand,
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?
The man said,
"No, like I said yesterday
We just sell lemonade OK?
Why not give it a try?"
The duck said,
"Goodbye."good day
