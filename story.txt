A duck walks up to a lemonade stand and asks the man there if they sell any grapes. The man tells the duck that he doesn't, as the only thing he sells is lemonade. He offered a glass of lemonade to the duck, but the duck replied, "I'll pass." And then the duck waddled away.

Nate's Paragraph
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man running the stand,
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?
The man said,
"No, like I said yesterday
We just sell lemonade OK?
Why not give it a try?"
The duck said,
"Goodbye."good day

(Bum bum bum bum ba-ba-dum)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man running the stand,
"Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any grapes?
The man said,
Look, this is getting old.
I mean, lemonade's all we've ever sold.
Why not give it a go?"
The duck said,
"How 'bout, no."
Then he waddled away
(Waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away.

When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man running the stand,
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"
The man said,
"THAT'S IT!
If you don't stay away, duck,
I'll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day, stuck
So don't get to close!"
The duck said,
"Adios."
Then he waddled away.

"Hey! (Bum bum bum) got any glue?"
"What"
"Got any glue?"
"No, why would Iâ€“ oh!"
And one more question for you;
"Got any grapes?"
(Bum bum bum, bum bum bum)
And the man just stopped.
Then he started to smile.
He started to laugh.
He laughed for a while.
He said,
"Come on duck, let's walk to the store.
I'll buy you some grapes
So you won't have to ask anymore."
So they walked to the store
And the man bought some grapes.
He gave one to the duck and the duck said,
"Hmmm..No thanks. But you know what sounds good?
It would make my day.
Do you think this store
Do you think this store
Do you think this store has any lemonade?"
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away
(Waddle waddle)
